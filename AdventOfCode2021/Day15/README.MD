<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 15: Chiton ---</h2><p>You've almost reached the exit of the cave, but the walls are getting closer together. Your submarine can barely still fit, though; the main problem is that the walls of the cave are covered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiton" target="_blank">chitons</a>, and it would be best not to bump any of them.</p>
<p>The cavern is large, but has a very low ceiling, restricting your motion to two dimensions. The shape of the cavern resembles a square; a quick scan of chiton density produces a map of <b>risk level</b> throughout the cave (your puzzle input). For example:</p>
<pre><code>1163751742
1381373672
2136511328
3694931569
7463417111
1319128137
1359912421

<p>You start in the top left position, your destination is the bottom right position, and you <span title="Can't go diagonal until we can repair the caterpillar unit. Could be the liquid helium or the superconductors.">cannot move diagonally</span>. The number at each position is its <b>risk level</b>; to determine the total risk of an entire path, add up the risk levels of each position you <b>enter</b> (that is, don't count the risk level of your starting position unless you enter it; leaving it adds no risk to your total).</p>
<p>Your goal is to find a path with the <b>lowest total risk</b>. In this example, a path with the lowest total risk is highlighted here:</p>
<pre><code><b>1</b>163751742
<b>1</b>381373672
<b>2136511</b>328
