<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 24: Lobby Layout ---</h2><p>Your raft makes it to the tropical island; it turns out that the small crab was an excellent navigator. You make your way to the resort.</p>
<p>As you enter the lobby, you discover a small problem: the floor is being renovated. You can't even reach the check-in desk until they've finished installing the <b>new tile floor</b>.</p>
<p>The tiles are all <b>hexagonal</b>; they need to be arranged in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_tiling">hex grid</a> with a very specific color pattern. Not in the mood to wait, you offer to help figure out the pattern.</p>
<p>The tiles are all <b>white</b> on one side and <b>black</b> on the other. They start with the white side facing up. The lobby is large enough to fit whatever pattern might need to appear there.</p>
<p>A member of the renovation crew gives you a <b>list of the tiles that need to be flipped over</b> (your puzzle input). Each line in the list identifies a single tile that needs to be flipped by giving a series of steps starting from a <b>reference tile</b> in the very center of the room. (Every line starts from the same reference tile.)</p>
<p>Because the tiles are hexagonal, every tile has <b>six neighbors</b>: east, southeast, southwest, west, northwest, and northeast. These directions are given in your list, respectively, as <code>e</code>, <code>se</code>, <code>sw</code>, <code>w</code>, <code>nw</code>, and <code>ne</code>. A tile is identified by a series of these directions with <b>no delimiters</b>; for example, <code>esenee</code> identifies the tile you land on if you start at the reference tile and then move one tile east, one tile southeast, one tile northeast, and one tile east.</p>
<p>Each time a tile is identified, it flips from white to black or from black to white. Tiles might be flipped more than once. For example, a line like <code>esew</code> flips a tile immediately adjacent to the reference tile, and a line like <code>nwwswee</code> flips the reference tile itself.</p>
<p>Here is a larger example:</p>
